# C_Programing-
This repository serves as a record of my progress as I learn C programming. 

I am aiming to build a strong foundation in C, understanding its syntax, principles, and best practices.

##Projects

Each project has its own directory with a README explaining the project and how to run or use it.

Here are some of the projects I've completed or am working on:

Project #:     Project Name:            A brief description of the project: 
01             HelloWorld       -       The program consists of a single main() function that prints the "Hello, World" message in two different ways.
02             FahrToCelsTable  -       This program converts Fahrenheit temperatures to Celsius and prints a table of values. 



##Exercises
I've also included various exercises to practice different aspects of C programming. These exercises cover topics like:

Variables and Data Types
Control Structures (if, else, loops)
Functions
Pointers and Memory Management
File I/O
