#Hello World in C

"The only way to learn a new programming language is by writing programs in it." 

The program consists of a single main() function that prints the "Hello, World!" message in two different ways.

##Description

    1. Using a single 'printf' statement with a newline character '\n'.
    2. Using two separate 'printf' statements:

##Requirements

 * C Compiler (e.g gcc/cc)

##How to compile and Run

To run this program depends on the system you are using. As a specific example, the program was created on UNIX operating system. 

###Compile the Program  by default. 

cc helloWorld.c

The compilation will proceed silently, and make a default executable file called: 

a.out


###Run the program run: 

./a.out

##Output

 Hello, World!
 Hello, World!!
 
 ##Note: 
 
 If you are like me who love to rename the compiled version of the program instead of going with the default value, follow the following commands:

##Compile the program 

cc -o helloWorld helloWorld.c 

where cc is the command for compiling the code, and -o is a an option to create an executable with the name helloWorld from the program helloWorld.c

##Run the program

./helloWorld

##Output

 Hello, World!
 Hello, World!!
